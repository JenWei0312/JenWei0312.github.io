I love connecting with fellow builders and researchers. To make our interactions as productive as possible, here are the best ways to engage:

- For Open Source / Research Collaboration: If you have a specific, substantive idea for a collaboration on a topic of mutual interest (like distributed optimizers or RL for reasoning), feel free to reach out with a detailed proposal.

- For Advisory & Mentorship: For those seeking strategic guidance, project advice, or mentorship, I offer paid introductory advisory sessions. These 1-hour deep dives are designed to provide key references and discuss practical design trade-offs for your specific project.

- For Speaking Engagements: I am available for a limited number of speaking opportunities on topics related to my research.

Due to the volume of requests, I'm unfortunately unable to offer free one-on-one mentorship or project guidance via DMs. Thank you for your understanding.
