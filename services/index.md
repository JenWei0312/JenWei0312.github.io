> *I help early-stage teams and researchers turn complex AI ideas into working systems.*


## **🧠 Consulting for Startups & Research Teams**

I help teams bring real technical depth into their AI roadmap — without the overhead of hiring full-time.
My focus is on **first-principles design** and **efficient execution**, bridging foundational research and practical engineering.

**What I can help with:**

* **System Architecture:** Translating product or research goals into scalable, maintainable AI systems.
* **Prototype to Production:** Designing and implementing proofs of concept that evolve into robust pipelines.
* **Optimization & Scaling:** Guidance on distributed training, fine-tuning, and performance efficiency.
* **R&D Enablement:** Technical mentorship and architecture reviews for early-stage or expanding AI teams.

## **🔍 Research & Open Collaboration**

If you’re working on **optimizers, reinforcement learning for reasoning, or distributed model training**, I’m open to collaborations that push boundaries.
I bring a hands-on approach — combining implementation, experimentation, and interpretability.

## **🎤 Speaking & Education**

As a PyData Global 2025 speaker and independent researcher, I occasionally take on talks, workshops, and guest sessions around:

* Distributed training & system design
* Reinforcement learning for reasoning tasks
* Understanding model architectures from first principles
