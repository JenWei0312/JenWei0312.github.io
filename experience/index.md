**Independent AI Researcher (2024 – Present)**

Pursuing first-principles AI research focused on optimizers (Muon) and distributed training (FSDP, ZeRO). I explore the “distributed chaos” problem — how synchronization, communication, and memory efficiency shape the economics of large-scale training. 

**Impact:** My write-ups and annotated codebases have helped hundreds of engineers and researchers understand the systems that underpin frontier-scale AI.
