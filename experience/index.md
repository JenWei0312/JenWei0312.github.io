**Independent AI Researcher (2024 – Present)**

I lead self-directed foundational AI research across the full model lifecycle — from pretraining mechanisms to post-training alignment, optimization, and distributed systems.

My work combines first-principles understanding with implementation-level depth. Rather than fine-tuning APIs, I build and analyze core components from scratch — focusing on how modern intelligence systems actually work under the hood.

**Focus Areas:**
- **Pretraining:** Implemented architectures like DeepSeek’s Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) from first principles.  
- **Post-training:** Recreated and visualized alignment and reinforcement methods such as DPO, GRPO, and ReTool, including hands-on implementations for strategic tool use in LLMs.  
- **Optimization:** Authored *“Understanding the Muon Optimizer”* — a deep dive into the theory, math, and implementation of a frontier optimizer used in record-breaking training runs.  
- **Distributed Systems:** Currently investigating FSDP and ZeRO architectures — decoding how synchronization, communication, and memory define the economics of large-scale model training.  

**Impact:**  
My annotated codebases, tutorials, and visual guides have been widely used by practitioners learning foundational AI from scratch.  
This line of work culminated in my upcoming PyData Global 2025 talk:  
_“I Built a Transformer from Scratch So You Don’t Have To.”_
