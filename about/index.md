Hi there, my name is Jen Wei.

As a Full-stack AI Researcher with a PhD in Applied Math, my mission is to bridge the gap between dense theoretical research and efficient, production-ready systems. This December, I'll be sharing this first-principles approach on a global stage, speaking at [**PyData Global 2025**](https://pydata.org/global2025/schedule) on my talk, "I Built a Transformer from Scratch So You Donâ€™t Have To."

My approach is grounded in deconstructing, building, and optimizing complex architectures from the ground up. My current research is focused on the frontier of large-scale model training, where I am actively implementing and analyzing novel optimizers like Muon and navigating the immense challenges of distributed training frameworks such as PyTorch FSDP. This builds on my foundational work in:

- RL Architectures: Implementing end-to-end systems like ReTool for strategic tool use. 
- Advanced Mechanisms: Building DeepSeek's MLA and MoE from scratch. 
- Core Transformers: Authoring the tutorials and code that my PyData talk is based on.

My unique value lies at the intersection of mathematics, model architecture, and systems engineering. I thrive on translating complex algorithms into functional, scalable code. I'm always open to collaborating on the hard problems in AI, particularly in optimizers, distributed training, and RL for reasoning.
