Hi there, my name is Jen Wei.

I'm a **T-shaped AI researcher** — a generalist by curiosity, a specialist by discipline.  
My work sits at the intersection of deep technical research and applied problem-solving: from model architectures and optimization to distributed training and real-world deployment.

I earned a **PhD in Applied Mathematics and an MS in Statistics** through a dual-degree program — training that taught me to think from first principles, set high standards, and always ask *why*.  
Years of building real systems from scratch taught me the other side of the equation: how to turn those ideas into working code.  

In many ways, I’m a hybrid between **scientist and engineer** — I ask “why” more deeply than most engineers, and I think “how” more concretely than most scientists. That balance drives how I approach every project: analytical in reasoning, pragmatic in execution.

Over the past decade, I’ve moved between three worlds:
- **Enterprise data science**, where I led quantitative modeling for energy and utilities — translating between regulators, traders, and algorithms.  
- **Startup R&D**, where I was the first hire on a 3D vision SDK team and built the system from zero lines of code to alpha release.  
- **Independent research**, where I focus on the hard engineering behind modern AI — implementing optimizers like *Muon*, experimenting with distributed frameworks (*FSDP, ZeRO*), and teaching others how these systems actually work.

I’m currently a [**speaker at PyData Global 2025**](https://pydata.org/global2025/schedule), presenting my talk *“I Built a Transformer from Scratch So You Don’t Have To.”*  
Beyond code and research, I’m passionate about helping others connect the dots — between theory, architecture, and real impact.

Whether you’re scaling AI infrastructure, exploring reinforcement learning for reasoning, or looking for someone who can go from first principles to production — I’m always up for tackling the next hard problem.
