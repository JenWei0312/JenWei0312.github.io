You can find most of my work on 🤗 [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/bird-of-paradise). As a full-stack foundational AI researcher, my work covers

<br>

**Pre Training**

- My impementations for [DeepSeek Multi-Head Latent Attention](https://huggingface.co/bird-of-paradise/deepseek-mla), and [DeepSeek MoE](https://huggingface.co/bird-of-paradise/deepseek-moe)

- My tutorial on [Implementing Transformer from Scratch: A Step-by-Step Guide](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bird-of-paradise/transformer-from-scratch-tutorial)

<br>

**Post Training**

- My implementation for [ReTool: Reinforcement Learning for Strategic Tool Use in LLMs](https://huggingface.co/spaces/bird-of-paradise/ReTool-Implementation)

- [🔧 Beyond Pretraining: Post-Training Techniques for LLMs: Distillation, Preference Optimization, and RLHF — Visualized](https://huggingface.co/spaces/bird-of-paradise/post-training-techniques-guide)

<br>

**Optimizer**

- My tutorial on [Understanding the Muon Optimizer: Theory and Implementation](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bird-of-paradise/muon-tutorial)

<br>

**Distributed Training**
- My reverse-engineered, annotated re-implementation of Moonshot’s Muon Is Scalable paper [Distributed Muon: CPU-Friendly Implementation of a Multi-Node Optimizer
